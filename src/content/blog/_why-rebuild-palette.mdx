This post (hopefully) will be part of a series where I consider why I'm building what I'm building. Because I undertake a lot of projects, I think this could double as context for others and accountability for myself.

Two years ago, LLM early days, I made a site which created a color palette from an app description. It was simpler time and the internet was glad.

Now after some twists and turns, I find myself rewriting the app for Tailwind 4. Y tho?

_Design System-ing_ is exhausting. I deeply respect everyone who has ever thrown their hat into the ring and created a design system-system.

From Bootstrap to Shadcn, when a design system-system succeeds I always wonder whether it's the developer experience, or the style itself (which somewhat contradicts the purpose of being a design system-system)? In most cases, it's probably both, seasoned with a healthy dose of marketing and luck.

### But why rebuild Palette?

The short answer: To build apps more quickly and make them look more professional.

So why rebuild Palette? Two simple reasons:

1. There's a clear demand for it
2. It will save me (and others) time

I can envision turning that demand into a sustainable income stream while helping developers get from zero to MVP faster. Those reasons alone justify the effort.

And yes, putting these thoughts out here might make me seem a bit lost. But if I am lost, at least this way I'm leaving a trail to be found.

But there's a deeper question lurking here about automation and personality in web development. If we're comfortable with advances in transportation and communication transforming our world, why do we draw the line at automating the choice of button colors on websites?

I should note: I have nothing against tangible computing, folk computing, organic computing, slow computing, or the indie web. I deeply appreciate movements that celebrate the craft of coding and the spirit of the early web.

Here's my perspective: Painting remains enjoyable despite not being the fastest way to create portraits for three centuries. Similarly, coding can be fun even when it's no longer the most efficient way to create software.

We can appreciate a craft, recognize its limits, and celebrate its pioneers without becoming protectionist. Thinking "automation stops here" for our specific skills feels narrow-minded.

(It's telling that I needed this much philosophical justification just to talk about building a design system. Clearly, I'm working through some things.)

At this point in writing, I asked GPT to find my blind spot â€“ because I could feel there was one. It responded: "There's a tension between pragmatism and sentimentality in your perspective, and you might not fully see how much you're still emotionally tied to the craft, even as you try to intellectually argue past it." Facts, as they say.
